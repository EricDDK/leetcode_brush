﻿//You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
//
//Suppose you have n versions[1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
//
//You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad.Implement a function to find the first bad version.You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
